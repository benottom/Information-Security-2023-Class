# ["Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains"](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) white paper from Lockheed Martin Corporation by Eric M. Hutchins, Michael J. Cloppert, Rohan M. Amin, Ph.D.

## Summary
The article discusses how traditional network defense tools such as intrusion detection systems and anti-virus are no longer sufficient to protect against advanced persistent threats (APTs). APTs are well-resourced and trained adversaries who conduct long-term intrusion campaigns targeting sensitive information. The article suggests that an intelligence-based model of network defense, which uses a kill chain model and maps adversary indicators to defender courses of action, is necessary to mitigate the threat component of risk in addition to vulnerability.
